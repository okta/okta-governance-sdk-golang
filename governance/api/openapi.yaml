    Access certification campaigns allow key stakeholders to periodically review users’ access to resources. Okta can then modify resource access, based on stakeholder reviews. Manage campaign tasks with the following campaign APIs.

    A catalog entry represents a requestable resource for [Access Requests](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-ar). Each requestable app or collection has a top-level entry in the catalog. These are known as parent catalog entries. Associated requestable entitlements and groups also have an entry in the catalog, known as child entries. For example, a top-level entry for Figma might have two child entries, one for requesting read-only access to Figma and one for requesting edit access.

     The `parent` property in the catalog entry object shows the relationship between child and parent. The child entry's `parent` property references their respective parent entry identifier. The parent entry's `parent` property has no value. See the [CATALOG-ENTRY](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/#CATALOG-ENTRY) diagram in the [Relationships](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/#relationships) model.

    Use the Catalogs API to request for catalog entries as a principal with admin privileges. You can search for a list of catalog entries based on the entry parent-child relationship using the `filter` query parameter.

    Grants represent an assignment or revocation of entitlements or entitlement bundles to a principal. A principal can have multiple grants.

    Grant types can have different behavior characteristics.

    ### Base
    A principal and resource can only have a single base grant. Creating a base grant type replaces all other existing grants. The following grant types are available:

    - **POLICY**: Creates a grant for a principal driven by existing policy rules defined for the app.
    - **CUSTOM**: Creates a grant for a principal with specific entitlement and respective values.

    ### Additive
    A principal entitlement can have multiple additive grant types. These are applied based on the order that they were granted. Currently, only the following grant type is available:

    - **ENTITLEMENT-BUNDLE**: Creates a grant for a user with a specific entitlement bundle.

    Request conditions define what resources and access levels requesters can request from their resource catalog.

    Each request condition defines the following:

    - Who can request access
    - What resource and access level they can request
    - How long the access should be granted for
    - What request sequence to use for approval
    - A priority to control what condition should take precedence when a requester matches against multiple request conditions

    A request condition must refer to one request sequence.

    The following request sequence APIs may be used to retrieve request sequence data necessary for managing request conditions.

        Deletes a campaign from your organization.

        Only campaigns with a status of `SCHEDULED` or `ERROR` can be deleted. Attempting this operation with campaigns in any other status yields a `409 Conflict` response indicating the state of the campaign is incompatible with the delete operation.

        If the campaign being deleted has a schedule type `RECURRING`, then any occurence of future campaigns as per recurring schedule, will not happen.

        >**Note:** There is a limit on the number of campaigns with a status of `SCHEDULED`. Deleting campaigns that are never meant to be launched (whether through the launch operation or automatically through `scheduleSettings`), can be useful to remain under this limit.

        Ends a campaign before its scheduled end date (from `scheduleSettings`).

        This operation closes any open reviews and prevents any further review activity, such as decisions or reassignments. Reviews associated with the campaign are remediated, if the remediation setting for the campaign is set.

        Only campaigns with a status of `ACTIVE` can be completed. A valid end operation transitions a campaign to a status of `COMPLETED`. Attempting this operation with campaigns in any other status yields a `409 Conflict` response indicating the state of the campaign is incompatible with the end campaign operation.

        >**Note:** This operation is optional. Typically, campaigns are completed automatically according to the campaign's schedule settings `scheduleSettings`.

        Reassigns a review to another reviewer.

        Reassigning a review is useful in cases where the currently assigned reviewer is not able to make a decision before the campaign ends.

        Only reviews belonging to campaigns with a status of `READY` can be reassigned. And only those reviews with decision `UNREVIEWED` can be reassigned.

        If reviews are currently being reviewed by a group (when `reviewerType` is `GROUP` or `RESOURCE_OWNER`), on reassignment, reviews is directly assigned to the chosen new reviewer and `reviewerType` is changed to `USER`.

        A valid reassignment changes an existing reviewer to a new reviewer (`userId`), and appends the change to the reassignment history.

        To reassign a set of reviews, you must specify:

        - the Okta `user.id` of the new reviewer

        - a list of `reviewIds` to be re-assigned

        - The `reviewerLevel` at which the reviews needs to be re-assigned (Applicable only for multi level campaigns)

        - a `note` justifying the reassignment decision for the specified reviews

        Creates a request to access a resource in your organization.

        When creating a request, you specify:

        - the request type (`requestTypeId`) to use for the request
        - and the subject line (`subject`) of the request

        Optionally, you can specify:

        - The requester user IDs for the request. If not provided, user IDs are obtained from the user identity of the `API Token` or `Access Token`.

    get:
      description: |
        Lists reviews for your organization.

        You can return a subset of reviews if a filter expression (`?filter=`) is provided.

        Supported filters are:

        - `campaignId`: string
        - `principalId`: string
        - `reviewerId`: string
        - `decision`: string (APPROVE, REVOKE, UNREVIEWED)
        - `resourceId`: string (`GroupId` or `AppId`)
        - `reviewerType`: string (`USER` or `GROUP` or `RESOURCE_OWNER`)
        - `reviewerLevel`: string (`FIRST` or `SECOND`)
        - `entitlementValueId`: string
        - `entitlementBundleId`: string

        Pagination parameters are accepted, and standard link headers are in the response.

        Reviews exist only for campaigns that have been launched with a status of `ACTIVE` or `COMPLETED`.
        Also note that, if reviews are still `UNREVIEWED`, then the property `decided` would be null. If the remediation is not completed, then `remediationStatus` would be null too.

        The order criteria (`orderBy`) applies to the following properties: `decided`, `decision`, `remediationStatus`, and `created`.

        By default, results are sorted by `created`.

        Note: Calling this endpoint without a filter would require fetching a large amount of data. If your org has a large number of campaigns and reviews,
        the request might time out or fail. To ensure reliable performance, we strongly recommend that you fetch data on a per-campaign basis using the provided filters.

        Retrieves request fields for catalog entry

        Request fields are determined by evaluating the entry's associated
        request conditions for the requester.

        The highest priority matching
        condition determines the approval sequence that will be used for the
        requester.

        If that approval sequence has requester fields, then they will
        be returned as a request field.

        If the request can lead to any separation of duty conflicts, then
        the risk assessment is present. The risk assessment indicates whether
        request submission is allowed or restricted and includes rules that
        lead to the possible conflicts. If request submission is allowed, then
        the request fields are determined by the associated approval sequence.

        Retrieves request fields for my catalog entry

        Request fields are determined by evaluating the entry's associated
        request conditions for the requester.

        The highest priority matching
        condition determines the approval sequence that will be used for the
        requester.

        If that approval sequence has requester fields, then they will
        be returned as a request field.

        If the request can lead to any separation of duty conflicts, then
        the risk assessment is present. The risk assessment indicates whether
        request submission is allowed or restricted and includes rules that
        lead to the possible conflicts. If request submission is allowed, then
        the request fields are determined by the associated approval sequence.

          Creates a resource access request for a given user

          You can use this endpoint to create access requests managed by access request conditions.

          If `requestedBy` and `requestedFor` are not the same, you must also enable the `requestOnBehalfOfSettings` property on the Access request settings. See [Request Settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings/operation/updateResourceRequestSettingsV2!path=requestOnBehalfOfSettings&t=request).

          As part of the payload for the Create a request endpoint, include the following information:

          - The Okta user ID for the user who requires access. Add the user ID in the `requestedFor.externalId` parameter.
          - The Catalog entry ID of the resource required by the user. Add the catalog ID in the `requested.entryId` parameter.
          - If the request conditions include requester input fields, add the field and information for the field to the `requesterFieldValues` array. See [Retrieve an entry's request fields](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Catalogs/#tag/Catalogs/operation/getCatalogEntryRequestFieldsV2).
          - Optional: The user ID of the person submitting the request. By default, this value is the admin user ID calling the endpoint and doesn't need to be provided. However, to add a different Okta user ID for the request, include the `requestedBy.externalId` parameter in the request body.

        Retrieves the entry's request fields for the specified requester.
        Request fields for the entry are only returned if the entry has request on behalf of enabled, and the authorized user is able to request on behalf of other requesters.

        If the request can lead to any separation of duty conflicts, then
        the risk assessment is present. The risk assessment indicates whether
        request submission is allowed or restricted and includes rules that
        lead to the possible conflicts. If request submission is allowed, then
        the request fields are determined by the associated approval sequence
        for the risk level.

        Lists the requests made by users in your org

        You can use this endpoint to retrieve all access requests managed by access request conditions.

        The `filter` parameter, a SCIM query string, supports the following attributes to narrow down the results:
        - `status`: The status of the request. Possible values: `SUBMITTED`, `REJECTED`, `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `DENIED`, `CANCELED`, `EXPIRED`
        - `lastUpdated`: The last updated time of the request
        - `requestedFor`: The Okta user ID for whom the request is made
        - `resourceId`: The Okta resource ID for which the request is made
        - `resourceType`: The type of resource for which the request is made. Possible values: `APPLICATION`
        - `accessScopeId`: The ID of the resource access scope for which the request is made
        - `accessScopeType`: The type of the resource access scope for which the request is made. Possible values: `ENTITLEMENT_BUNDLE`, `GROUP`, `APPLICATION`

        Pagination parameters are accepted, and standard link headers are in the response.

        Creates a resource access request for a given user

        You can use this endpoint to create access requests managed by access request conditions.

        If `requestedBy` and `requestedFor` are not the same, you must also enable the `requestOnBehalfOfSettings` property on the Access request settings. See [Request Settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings/operation/updateResourceRequestSettingsV2!path=requestOnBehalfOfSettings&t=request).

        As part of the payload for the Create a request endpoint, include the following information:

        - The Okta user ID for the user who requires access. Add the user ID in the `requestedFor.externalId` parameter.
        - The Catalog entry ID of the resource required by the user. Add the catalog ID in the `requested.entryId` parameter.
        - If the request conditions include requester input fields, add the field and information for the field to the `requesterFieldValues` array. See [Retrieve an entry's request fields](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Catalogs/#tag/Catalogs/operation/getCatalogEntryRequestFieldsV2).
        - Optional: The user ID of the person submitting the request. By default, this value is the admin user ID calling the endpoint and doesn't need to be provided. However, to add a different Okta user ID for the request, include the `requestedBy.externalId` parameter in the request body.

        Creates a request condition, which governs how a resource can be requested.

        When creating a request condition, you specify:

        - What resource can be requested? (`resourceId` in path)
        - What access scope can be requested? (`accessScopeSettings` in request body)
        - Who can request access? (`requesterSettings` in request body)
        - What is the approval process? (`approvalSequenceId` in request body)

        Any `requesterSettings`, `accessScopeSettings` in the update request body will be validated against the resource's current request settings.

        Request conditions will have an inactive status after succesful creation.

        Updates the request condition

        Conditions can be updated while their status is ACTIVE, INACTIVE or INVALID.

        An update will be rejected if it would lead to the condition entering an INVALID status.

        While an update request body may not contain `status`, a successful update request condition operation will always result in the condition entering ACTIVE or INACTIVE status.

        Any `requesterSettings`, `accessScopeSettings` in the update request body will be validated against the resource's current request settings.

        Retrieves the request settings for a resource

        Resource request settings are useful for determining what kind of request conditions
        can be created or updated for a resource.

        For example:

        - `validAccessScopeSettings` indicates what `accessScopeSettings` may be passed in a `Create request condition` or `Update request condition` operation.
        - `validRequesterSettings` indicates what `requesterSettings` may be passed in a `Create request condition` or `Update request condition` operation.
        - `validAccessDurationSettings` indicates the maximum duration the user will have access to the resources.
        - `validRiskSettings` indicates what `riskSettings` may be passed. Currently, it can be at the resource request settings.
        - `requestOnBehalfOfSettings` if they exist, they indicate the settings specified for request on behalf of.
        - `riskSettings` if they exist, they indicate the risk settings specified for the resource.

        See response examples for various possible request setting scenarios.

        Requests may be rejected for several reasons:
         - If a request can't be matched to any request condition, it will lack an approval sequence and
           matched condition.
         - If a request does match a request condition but fails validation, it will have an approval sequence
           and matched condition, yet still be rejected due to validation failure.

        Applicable only, if `interval` is in terms of N months. Specifies the day-of-the-month on which, the campaign should be repeated. If the `interval` is in terms of days, weeks or years, this property can be ignored.

        1) `SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the day-of-the-month in `startDate`. For eg: if `startDate` happens to be `5th` of some date, then campaign will repeat on 5th day of the matching month.

        2) `SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the day-of-the-week in `startDate`. For eg if `startDate` happens to be `Thursday`, then campaign will repeat on `Thursday` of the matching week.

        2) `LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the last day-of-the-week in `startDate`. For eg jf `startDate` happens to be `Thursday` and it is the last week of the month, then campaign will repeat on `Thursday` of the matching last week.

        Refer few examples below:
          1) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P3M` (Every 3 months) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE`- the `startDate` happens to be in the first week, and it is a `Thursday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `3 months` and will start on `first week's Thursday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|
              | 2           | Sep  7th, Thursday,  2023|
              | 3           | Dec  7th, Thursday,  2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          2) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be `1st` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `1st day of the month`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|
              | 2           | Jul  1st, Saturday,  2023|
              | 3           | Aug  1st, Tuesday,   2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          3) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the first week, and it is a `Thursday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `first week's Thursday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|

              |...          |                          |

          4) Let's say the campaign start date is `May 23rd 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the fourth week, and it is a `Tuesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `fourth week's Tuesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | May  23rd, Tuesday,  2023|

          5) Let's say the campaign start date is `May 29rd 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the last week, and it is a `Monday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Monday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | May  29th, Monday,   2023|
              | 2           | Jun  26th, Monday,   2023|
              | 3           | Jul  31st, Monday,   2023|
              | 4           | Aug  28th, Monday,   2023|
              |...          |                          |

          6) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 28th 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be `28th` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `28th day of the month`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun 28th, Wednesday, 2023|

              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          7) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 28th 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be the last week of the month, and it is a `Wednesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Wednesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun 28th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 2           | Jul 26th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 3           | Aug 30th, Wednesday, 2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          8) Let's say the campaign start date is `Jan 31st 2024`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be the last week of the month, and it is a `Wednesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Wednesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jan 31st, Wednesday, 2024|
              | 2           | Feb 28th, Wednesday, 2024|
              | 3           | Mar 27th, Wednesday, 2024|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          9) Let's say the campaign start date is `Jan 31st 2024`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be `31st` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `31st` or `30th` or `28/29th`(for February). In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |

        Applicable for recurring campaigns only (`type: RECURRING`).
        You can specify the campaign recurring frequency using `interval` and `repeatOn`.
        Optionally specify `ends` with a date-time, when the campaign schedule can end.
      properties:
        interval:
          description: |
            Recurrence interval specified according to ISO8061 notation for durations.
            Refer https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html for all supported values.
            Recurring campaigns support - daily, weekly, monthly and yearly interval.
            One can setup a "interval" to max of -
              - 182 days (That is `P182D`)
              - 26 weeks (equivalent of 182 days, that is `P26W`)
              - 24 months (That is `P24M`)
              - 2 years (That is `P2Y`).

            Few examples to better understand, how `interval` is used.
            If the `startDate` is `June 28th 2023` and the intent is to repeat the campaign -
              1) Every 25 days, specify "P25D".
              2) Every 4 weeks specify "P4W". In this example the `startDate` happens to be a `Wednesday`, the campaign would run every `Wednesday` of 4th week of the month.
              3) Every 3 months specify "P3M". In this example the `startDate` is on 28th day. Hence, campaigns repeats every 3 months on 28th day.
              4) Every 2 years specify "P2Y". In this example, the `startDate` is `Jun 28`. Hence repeats every 2 yrs on `Jun 28th`.

              Also note that, the `interval` should not conflict `durationInDays`. For eg: If `durationInDays` is specified as 21 days, but interval is `P2W` (Every 2 weeks), it becomes an invalid request, as duration of the campaign conflicts with the next recurrence of the campaign.

        1) `type = USER`: a single reviewer reviews the whole campaign. The property `reviewerId` is required for this type.

        2) `type = REVIEWER_EXPRESSION`: specifies an expression to derive a reviewer for the whole campaign. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required for this type. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if the system can't determine the reviewer using the expression. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes the automatic reviewer of the campaign. This type can represent reviews based on the user manager as well. In such a case, the reviewer expression is framed to indicate the user manager.

        3) `type = GROUP`: All the members of an Okta group specified through `reviewerGroupId` become reviewers of the campaign. The property `reviewerGroupId` is required for this type. Note that if the group is specified through `reviewerGroupId` and has only one member, then that reviewer is assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` in those reviews changes to `USER`.

        4) `type = RESOURCE_OWNER`: All the owners of an Okta group become reviewers of the campaign. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required for this type. For `RESOURCE_OWNER` to work, set the property `resourceSettings.type` to `GROUP` and `resourceSettings.targetResources` to an Okta group ID. Access Certifications derives all the owners of the groups specified through`resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId` and assigns them as reviewers to respective reviews of the campaign. Note that, if there is only one owner for such group(s) then that owner is assigned as a reviewer to respective reviews and `type` in those reviews changes to `USER`. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if the system can't determine the reviewer using the group(s) specified through `resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId`. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes automatic reviewer of the campaign.
        Note that, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 members, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 members are pulled from the group. Those 10 members become the reviewers of the campaign. When fetching members of the group, there's no order guaranteed. Additionally, if the Okta group specified has only one member, then that member is assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` for those reviews changes to `USER`.

        5) `type = MULTI_LEVEL`: a campaign that can be composed of more than one reviewer level. The property `reviewerLevels` is required. The campaign can be reviewed and passed on from reviewer at one level to the reviewer defined in the next level. This setting provides more than one reviewer who can decide on the reviews before making the final decision. A maximum of two reviewer levels are supported. One has the flexibility to choose a combination of reviewers when defining the campaign. When a campaign is defined as multi level, only the property `reviewerLevels` is required. All other properties are ignored.
        Note that, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 owners, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 owners are pulled from the group. Those 10 owners become the reviewers of the campaign. When fetching owners of the group, there's no order guaranteed. Additionally, if the Okta group specified has only one owner, then that owner is assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` for those reviews changes to `USER`.

        reviewerLevels:
          description: |
            Definition of reviewer level for a given campaign. Each reviewer level defines the kind of reviewer who is going to review.

            Each reviewer level defines the reviewer `type`.

              - `type = USER`: a single reviewer reviews at that level. The property `reviewerId` is required.
              - `type = REVIEWER_EXPRESSION`: specifies an expression to derive a reviewer for that level. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if Access Certifications can't determine the reviewer using the expression. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes automatic reviewer at that level.
              - `type = GROUP`: all the members of an Okta group specified through `reviewerGroupId` become reviewers at that level. The property `reviewerGroupId` is required.
                Note that, if the group specified through `reviewerGroupId` has only one member, then that member will be assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` at that level changes to `USER`.
                Additionally, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 members, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 members will be pulled from the group.
                Those 10 members would be the reviewers at that level. When fetching members of the group, there is no order guaranteed.
              - `type = RESOURCE_OWNER`: all the owners of an Okta group become reviewers at that level. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required. For `RESOURCE_OWNER` to work, the property `resourceSettings.type` should be `GROUP` and `resourceSettings.targetResources` should be an Okta group ID. Access Certifications derives all the owners of the groups specified through `resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId` and assigns them as reviewers to respective reviews of the campaign. Note that, if there is only one owner for such group(s) then that owner will be assigned as a reviewer to respective reviews and type in those reviews changes to `USER`. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if Access Certifications can't determine the reviewer using the group(s) specified through `resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId`. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes automatic reviewer of the campaign.
                Note that, if the Okta group specified has only one member, then that owner will be assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` at that level changes to `USER`.
                Additionally, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 owners, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 owners will be pulled from the group.
                Those 10 owners would be the reviewers at that level. When fetching owners of the group, there is no order guaranteed.

            Additionally -
              - The property `startReview.onDay` indicates from which day, the level should start. This property will be `0` for `FIRST` reviewer level, as the first level will start when the campaign starts. For `SECOND` reviewer level specify a value greater than `0`.
              - The property `startReview.when` indicates the condition when the lower level reviews will move to that level. This property should not be set for `FIRST` reviewer level. Only `SECOND` reviewer level will have the appropriate condition.

        A request type has a status lifecycle described in our [request type lifecycle documentation](/#request-type-status-lifecycle).

        A request type may start with a status of DRAFT or ACTIVE, based on the status property in the Add request body.

        The publish, unpublish, and delete operations all affect a request type's status.

        Additionally, if any operation detects invalid settings, such as an approver who is no longer in the organization, the request type automatically transitions to disabled.

        A request has a lifecycle. See our [request lifecycle documentation](/#request).

        A request progresses in its lifecycle state based on requester, approver, and administrator activities across a variety of channels, such as:

        - Access Request portal
        - Slack
        - Microsoft teams

        The following lifecycle operations are available on a single request.

            The ID of a `requesterField`.

            For `OKTA` request approval, this is typically the ID of an input field defined in an approval sequence.

            For `EXTERNAL` request approval, this is the ID of an input field relevant to the external approval system.

            The following are reserved identifiers:
            - `ACCESS_DURATION`: An identifier used to specify the duration of the access being requested. (**Note:**
              This identifier is to be grandfathered. The new name will be `OKTA_ACCESS_DURATION`.)
            - `OKTA_REQUESTED_FOR`: An identifier used to specify who the resource is being requested for
            - `OKTA_ACCESS_DURATION`: An identifier used to specify the duration of the requested access. If a request
              field is included in this ID, the field value must be a `DURATION` expression in ISO format. The maximum
              length of this value is 5 characters. For example, `P1D` represents a duration of one day.
            - Any identifiers with `OKTA_` prefix are reserved for future use.

            The value of `requesterField`, which depends on the type of the field:

            - `SELECT`: An option predefined by the approval system
            - `ISO_DATE`: An ISO formatted date string. for example, `2022-05-05T14:15:22Z`
            - `DURATION`: An ISO format duration expression with a maximum length of 5 characters. For example,
              `P1D` indicates a duration of one day.
            - `OKTA_USER_ID`: Okta User ID
