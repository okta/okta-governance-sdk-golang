      Access certification campaigns allow key stakeholders to periodically review users’ access to resources. Okta can then modify resource access, based on stakeholder reviews. Manage campaign tasks with the following campaign APIs.

      See [Identity Governance](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-iga) for more information on Access Campaigns and Identity Governance.

    description: |-
      Grants represent an assignment or revocation of entitlements or entitlement bundles to a principal. A principal can have multiple grants.

      Grant types can have different behavior characteristics.

      ### Base
      A principal and resource can only have a single base grant. Creating a base grant type replaces all other existing grants. The following grant types are available:

      - **POLICY**: Creates a grant for a principal driven by existing policy rules defined for the app.
      - **CUSTOM**: Creates a grant for a principal with specific entitlement and respective values.

      ### Additive
      A principal entitlement can have multiple additive grant types. These are applied based on the order that they were granted. Currently, only the following grant type is available:

      - **ENTITLEMENT-BUNDLE**: Creates a grant for a user with a specific entitlement bundle.

      See [Entitlement Management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-entitlement-mgt).

        Only campaigns with a status of `SCHEDULED` can be launched. A valid launch operation transitions a campaign to a status of `ACTIVE`.

        Attempting this operation with campaigns in any other status yields a `409 Conflict` response indicating the state of the campaign is incompatible with the launch operation.

        If the campaign being launched has a recurring definition, on successful response, one should get the newly launched campaign resource endpoint in HTTP header `location`.

        - `entitlementValueId`: string
        - `entitlementBundleId`: string

        Pagination parameters are accepted, and standard link headers are in the response.

        Reviews exist only for campaigns that have been launched with a status of `ACTIVE` or `COMPLETED`.
        Also note that, if reviews are still `UNREVIEWED`, then the property `decided` would be null. If the remediation is not completed, then `remediationStatus` would be null too.

        The order criteria (`orderBy`) applies to the following properties: `decided`, `decision`, `remediationStatus`, and `created`.

        By default, results are sorted by `created`.

        Note: Calling this endpoint without a filter would require fetching a large amount of data. If your org has a large number of campaigns and reviews, 
        the request might time out or fail. To ensure reliable performance, we strongly recommend that you fetch data on a per-campaign basis using the provided filters.

      description: |
        Reassigns a review to another reviewer.

        Reassigning a review is useful in cases where the currently assigned reviewer is not able to make a decision before the campaign ends.

        Only reviews belonging to campaigns with a status of `READY` can be reassigned. And only those reviews with decision `UNREVIEWED` can be reassigned.

        If reviews are currently being reviewed by a group (when `reviewerType` is `GROUP` or `RESOURCE_OWNER`), on reassignment, reviews is directly assigned to the chosen new reviewer and `reviewerType` is changed to `USER`.

        A valid reassignment changes an existing reviewer to a new reviewer (`userId`), and appends the change to the reassignment history.

        To reassign a set of reviews, you must specify:

        - the Okta `user.id` of the new reviewer

        - a list of `reviewIds` to be re-assigned

        - The `reviewerLevel` at which the reviews needs to be re-assigned (Applicable only for multi level campaigns)

        - a `note` justifying the reassignment decision for the specified reviews

      description: |
        Applicable only, if `interval` is in terms of N months. Specifies the day-of-the-month on which, the campaign should be repeated. If the `interval` is in terms of days, weeks or years, this property can be ignored.

        1) `SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the day-of-the-month in `startDate`. For eg: if `startDate` happens to be `5th` of some date, then campaign will repeat on 5th day of the matching month.

        2) `SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the day-of-the-week in `startDate`. For eg if `startDate` happens to be `Thursday`, then campaign will repeat on `Thursday` of the matching week.

        2) `LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the last day-of-the-week in `startDate`. For eg jf `startDate` happens to be `Thursday` and it is the last week of the month, then campaign will repeat on `Thursday` of the matching last week.

        Refer few examples below:
          1) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P3M` (Every 3 months) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE`- the `startDate` happens to be in the first week, and it is a `Thursday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `3 months` and will start on `first week's Thursday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|
              | 2           | Sep  7th, Thursday,  2023|
              | 3           | Dec  7th, Thursday,  2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          2) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be `1st` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `1st day of the month`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|
              | 2           | Jul  1st, Saturday,  2023|
              | 3           | Aug  1st, Tuesday,   2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          3) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the first week, and it is a `Thursday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `first week's Thursday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|

              |...          |                          |

          4) Let's say the campaign start date is `May 23rd 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the fourth week, and it is a `Tuesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `fourth week's Tuesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | May  23rd, Tuesday,  2023|

              |...          |                          |

          5) Let's say the campaign start date is `May 29rd 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the last week, and it is a `Monday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Monday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | May  29th, Monday,   2023|
              | 2           | Jun  26th, Monday,   2023|
              | 3           | Jul  31st, Monday,   2023|
              | 4           | Aug  28th, Monday,   2023|
              |...          |                          |

          6) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 28th 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be `28th` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `28th day of the month`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun 28th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 2           | Jul 28th, Friday,    2023|
              | 3           | Aug 28th, Monday,    2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          7) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 28th 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be the last week of the month, and it is a `Wednesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Wednesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun 28th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 2           | Jul 26th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 3           | Aug 30th, Wednesday, 2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          8) Let's say the campaign start date is `Jan 31st 2024`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be the last week of the month, and it is a `Wednesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Wednesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jan 31st, Wednesday, 2024|
              | 2           | Feb 28th, Wednesday, 2024|
              | 3           | Mar 27th, Wednesday, 2024|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          9) Let's say the campaign start date is `Jan 31st 2024`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be `31st` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `31st` or `30th` or `28/29th`(for February). In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|

        You can specify the campaign recurring frequency using `interval` and `repeatOn`.
        Optionally specify `ends` with a date-time, when the campaign schedule can end.
      required:
        - interval
      properties:
        interval:
          type: string
          format: duration
          description: |
            Recurrence interval specified according to ISO8061 notation for durations.
            Refer https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html for all supported values.
            Recurring campaigns support - daily, weekly, monthly and yearly interval.
            One can setup a "interval" to max of -
              - 182 days (That is `P182D`)
              - 26 weeks (equivalent of 182 days, that is `P26W`)
              - 24 months (That is `P24M`)
              - 2 years (That is `P2Y`).

            Few examples to better understand, how `interval` is used.
            If the `startDate` is `June 28th 2023` and the intent is to repeat the campaign -
              1) Every 25 days, specify "P25D".
              2) Every 4 weeks specify "P4W". In this example the `startDate` happens to be a `Wednesday`, the campaign would run every `Wednesday` of 4th week of the month.
              3) Every 3 months specify "P3M". In this example the `startDate` is on 28th day. Hence, campaigns repeats every 3 months on 28th day.
              4) Every 2 years specify "P2Y". In this example, the `startDate` is `Jun 28`. Hence repeats every 2 yrs on `Jun 28th`.

              Also note that, the `interval` should not conflict `durationInDays`. For eg: If `durationInDays` is specified as 21 days, but interval is `P2W` (Every 2 weeks), it becomes an invalid request, as duration of the campaign conflicts with the next recurrence of the campaign.

        1) `type = USER`: a single reviewer reviews the whole campaign. The property `reviewerId` is required for this type.

        2) `type = REVIEWER_EXPRESSION`: specifies an expression to derive a reviewer for the whole campaign. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required for this type. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if the system can't determine the reviewer using the expression. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes the automatic reviewer of the campaign. This type can represent reviews based on the user manager as well. In such a case, the reviewer expression is framed to indicate the user manager.

        3) `type = GROUP`: All the members of an Okta group specified through `reviewerGroupId` become reviewers of the campaign. The property `reviewerGroupId` is required for this type. Note that if the group is specified through `reviewerGroupId` and has only one member, then that reviewer is assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` in those reviews changes to `USER`.

        4) `type = RESOURCE_OWNER`: All the owners of an Okta group become reviewers of the campaign. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required for this type. For `RESOURCE_OWNER` to work, set the property `resourceSettings.type` to `GROUP` and `resourceSettings.targetResources` to an Okta group ID. Access Certifications derives all the owners of the groups specified through`resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId` and assigns them as reviewers to respective reviews of the campaign. Note that, if there is only one owner for such group(s) then that owner is assigned as a reviewer to respective reviews and `type` in those reviews changes to `USER`. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if the system can't determine the reviewer using the group(s) specified through `resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId`. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes automatic reviewer of the campaign.
        Note that, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 members, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 members are pulled from the group. Those 10 members become the reviewers of the campaign. When fetching members of the group, there's no order guaranteed. Additionally, if the Okta group specified has only one member, then that member is assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` for those reviews changes to `USER`.

        5) `type = MULTI_LEVEL`: a campaign that can be composed of more than one reviewer level. The property `reviewerLevels` is required. The campaign can be reviewed and passed on from reviewer at one level to the reviewer defined in the next level. This setting provides more than one reviewer who can decide on the reviews before making the final decision. A maximum of two reviewer levels are supported. One has the flexibility to choose a combination of reviewers when defining the campaign. When a campaign is defined as multi level, only the property `reviewerLevels` is required. All other properties are ignored.
        Note that, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 owners, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 owners are pulled from the group. Those 10 owners become the reviewers of the campaign. When fetching owners of the group, there's no order guaranteed. Additionally, if the Okta group specified has only one owner, then that owner is assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` for those reviews changes to `USER`.

            The `id` of an Okta group who will be assigned as a reviewer. By specifying `reviewerGroupId`, all reviews will be assigned to that group. Any user part of that group will automatically be the reviewers of the campaign.
            This is a conditional property to be provided, only when one wants to assign more than one reviewer and cannot use `reviewerId` or `reviewerScopeExpression`.

            Note that, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 members, when the campaign gets launched, only a max of 10 members will be pulled from the group.
            Those 10 members would be the reviewers of the campaign. When fetching members of the group, there is no order guaranteed.

            Additionally, if the Okta group specified has only one member, then that member will be assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` for those reviews changes to `USER`.

        reviewerLevels:
          description: |
            Definition of reviewer level for a given campaign. Each reviewer level defines the kind of reviewer who is going to review.

            Each reviewer level defines the reviewer `type`.

              - `type = USER`: a single reviewer reviews at that level. The property `reviewerId` is required.
              - `type = REVIEWER_EXPRESSION`: specifies an expression to derive a reviewer for that level. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if Access Certifications can't determine the reviewer using the expression. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes automatic reviewer at that level.
              - `type = GROUP`: all the members of an Okta group specified through `reviewerGroupId` become reviewers at that level. The property `reviewerGroupId` is required.
                Note that, if the group specified through `reviewerGroupId` has only one member, then that member will be assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` at that level changes to `USER`.
                Additionally, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 members, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 members will be pulled from the group.
                Those 10 members would be the reviewers at that level. When fetching members of the group, there is no order guaranteed.
              - `type = RESOURCE_OWNER`: all the owners of an Okta group become reviewers at that level. The property `fallBackReviewerId` is required. For `RESOURCE_OWNER` to work, the property `resourceSettings.type` should be `GROUP` and `resourceSettings.targetResources` should be an Okta group ID. Access Certifications derives all the owners of the groups specified through `resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId` and assigns them as reviewers to respective reviews of the campaign. Note that, if there is only one owner for such group(s) then that owner will be assigned as a reviewer to respective reviews and type in those reviews changes to `USER`. Specify `fallBackReviewerId`, if Access Certifications can't determine the reviewer using the group(s) specified through `resourceSettings.targetResources.resourceId`. In such a case, the fallback reviewer specified through `fallBackReviewerId` becomes automatic reviewer of the campaign.
                Note that, if the Okta group specified has only one member, then that owner will be assigned as a reviewer to all reviewers and `type` at that level changes to `USER`.
                Additionally, if the provided Okta group has more than 10 owners, when the campaign gets launched, only a maximum of 10 owners will be pulled from the group.
                Those 10 owners would be the reviewers at that level. When fetching owners of the group, there is no order guaranteed.

            Additionally -
              - The property `startReview.onDay` indicates from which day, the level should start. This property will be `0` for `FIRST` reviewer level, as the first level will start when the campaign starts. For `SECOND` reviewer level specify a value greater than `0`.
              - The property `startReview.when` indicates the condition when the lower level reviews will move to that level. This property should not be set for `FIRST` reviewer level. Only `SECOND` reviewer level will have the appropriate condition.
