    description: |
      A catalog entry represents a requestable resource for [Access Requests](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-ar). Each requestable app or collection has a top-level entry in the catalog. These are known as parent catalog entries. Associated requestable entitlements and groups also have an entry in the catalog, known as child entries. For example, a top-level entry for Figma might have two child entries, one for requesting read-only access to Figma and one for requesting edit access.

       The `parent` property in the catalog entry object shows the relationship between child and parent. The child entry's `parent` property references their respective parent entry identifier. The parent entry's `parent` property has no value. See the [CATALOG-ENTRY](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/#CATALOG-ENTRY) diagram in the [Relationships](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/#relationships) model.

      Use the Catalogs API to request for catalog entries as a principal with admin privileges. You can search for a list of catalog entries based on the entry parent-child relationship using the `filter` query parameter.

  - name: Grants
    description: |-
      Grants represent an assignment or revocation of entitlements or entitlement bundles to a principal. A principal can have multiple grants.

      Grant types can have different behavior characteristics.

      ### Base
      A principal and resource can only have a single base grant. Creating a base grant type replaces all other existing grants. The following grant types are available:

      - **POLICY**: Creates a grant for a principal driven by existing policy rules defined for the app.
      - **CUSTOM**: Creates a grant for a principal with specific entitlement and respective values.

      ### Additive
      A principal entitlement can have multiple additive grant types. These are applied based on the order that they were granted. Currently, only the following grant type is available:

      - **ENTITLEMENT-BUNDLE**: Creates a grant for a user with a specific entitlement bundle.

      See [Entitlement Management](https://help.okta.com/okta_help.htm?type=oie&id=ext-entitlement-mgt).

      - Who can request access
      - What resource and access level they can request
      - How long the access should be granted for
      - What request sequence to use for approval
      - A priority to control what condition should take precedence when a requester matches against multiple request conditions

        Only campaigns with a status of `SCHEDULED` or `ERROR` can be deleted. Attempting this operation with campaigns in any other status yields a `409 Conflict` response indicating the state of the campaign is incompatible with the delete operation.

        If the campaign being deleted has a schedule type `RECURRING`, then any occurence of future campaigns as per recurring schedule, will not happen.

        >**Note:** There is a limit on the number of campaigns with a status of `SCHEDULED`. Deleting campaigns that are never meant to be launched (whether through the launch operation or automatically through `scheduleSettings`), can be useful to remain under this limit.

        This operation closes any open reviews and prevents any further review activity, such as decisions or reassignments. Reviews associated with the campaign are remediated, if the remediation setting for the campaign is set.

        Only campaigns with a status of `ACTIVE` can be completed. A valid end operation transitions a campaign to a status of `COMPLETED`. Attempting this operation with campaigns in any other status yields a `409 Conflict` response indicating the state of the campaign is incompatible with the end campaign operation.

        >**Note:** This operation is optional. Typically, campaigns are completed automatically according to the campaign's schedule settings `scheduleSettings`.

      summary: Reassign the reviews
      description: |
        Reassigns a review to another reviewer.

        Reassigning a review is useful in cases where the currently assigned reviewer is not able to make a decision before the campaign ends.

        Only reviews belonging to campaigns with a status of `READY` can be reassigned. And only those reviews with decision `UNREVIEWED` can be reassigned.

        If reviews are currently being reviewed by a group (when `reviewerType` is `GROUP` or `RESOURCE_OWNER`), on reassignment, reviews is directly assigned to the chosen new reviewer and `reviewerType` is changed to `USER`.

        A valid reassignment changes an existing reviewer to a new reviewer (`userId`), and appends the change to the reassignment history.

        To reassign a set of reviews, you must specify:

        - the Okta `user.id` of the new reviewer

        - a list of `reviewIds` to be re-assigned

        - The `reviewerLevel` at which the reviews needs to be re-assigned (Applicable only for multi level campaigns)

        - a `note` justifying the reassignment decision for the specified reviews

        Lists all resources without assigned owners for an app (the parent resource).

        For this request, you must specify the `filter` query parameter with a `parentResourceOrn` filter expression.
        This method returns all the resources for an app, such as entitlements or entitlement bundles, that don't have owners assigned.

      operationId: listReviews
      summary: List all reviews
      description: |
        Lists reviews for your organization.

        You can return a subset of reviews if a filter expression (`?filter=`) is provided.

        Supported filters are:

        - `campaignId`: string
        - `principalId`: string
        - `reviewerId`: string
        - `decision`: string (APPROVE, REVOKE, UNREVIEWED)
        - `resourceId`: string (`GroupId` or `AppId`)
        - `reviewerType`: string (`USER` or `GROUP` or `RESOURCE_OWNER`)
        - `reviewerLevel`: string (`FIRST` or `SECOND`)
        - `entitlementValueId`: string
        - `entitlementBundleId`: string

        Pagination parameters are accepted, and standard link headers are in the response.

        Reviews exist only for campaigns that have been launched with a status of `ACTIVE` or `COMPLETED`.
        Also note that, if reviews are still `UNREVIEWED`, then the property `decided` would be null. If the remediation is not completed, then `remediationStatus` would be null too.

        The order criteria (`orderBy`) applies to the following properties: `decided`, `decision`, `remediationStatus`, and `created`.

        By default, results are sorted by `created`.

        Note: Calling this endpoint without a filter would require fetching a large amount of data. If your org has a large number of campaigns and reviews,
        the request might time out or fail. To ensure reliable performance, we strongly recommend that you fetch data on a per-campaign basis using the provided filters.

        description: |
          Creates a resource access request for a given user.

          Use this operation to create access requests managed by access request conditions.

          If `requestedBy` and `requestedFor` aren't the same, then you must also enable the [`requestOnBehalfOfSettings`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings/operation/updateResourceRequestSettingsV2!path=requestOnBehalfOfSettings&t=request) parameter in the access request settings. See [Update the resource request settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings/operation/updateResourceRequestSettingsV2).

          Include the following information in the payload:

          - The Okta user ID for the user who requires access. Add the user ID in the `requestedFor.externalId` parameter.
          - The catalog entry ID of the resource required by the user. Add the catalog ID in the `requested.entryId` parameter.
          - If the request conditions include requester input fields, add field information in the `requesterFieldValues` array. See [Retrieve the request fields](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Catalogs/#tag/Catalogs/operation/getCatalogEntryRequestFieldsV2).
          - Optional: The user ID of the person submitting the request. By default, this value is the admin user ID requesting this operation and doesn't need to be provided. However, to add a different Okta user ID for the request, include the `requestedBy.externalId` parameter in the request body.

      description: |
        Retrieves the entry's request fields for the specified requester.

        Request fields for the entry are only returned if the entry has "request on behalf of" (`requestOnBehalfOfSettings`) enabled, and the authorized user is able to request on behalf of other requesters.

        If the request can lead to any separation of duty conflicts, then the risk assessment (`metadata.riskAssessment`) is returned.
        The risk assessment indicates whether the request submission is allowed or restricted, and includes rules that lead to the possible conflicts.
        If the request submission is allowed, then the request fields are determined by the associated approval sequence for the risk level.

        You can use this endpoint to retrieve all access requests managed by access request conditions.

        The `filter` parameter, a SCIM query string, supports the following attributes to narrow down the results:
        - `status`: The status of the request. Possible values: `SUBMITTED`, `REJECTED`, `PENDING`, `APPROVED`, `DENIED`, `CANCELED`, `EXPIRED`
        - `lastUpdated`: The last updated time of the request
        - `requestedFor`: The Okta user ID for whom the request is made
        - `resourceId`: The Okta resource ID for which the request is made
        - `resourceType`: The type of resource for which the request is made. Possible values: `APPLICATION`
        - `accessScopeId`: The ID of the resource access scope for which the request is made
        - `accessScopeType`: The type of the resource access scope for which the request is made. Possible values: `ENTITLEMENT_BUNDLE`, `GROUP`, `APPLICATION`

        Pagination parameters are accepted, and standard link headers are in the response.

      description: |
        Creates a resource access request for a given user.

        Use this operation to create access requests managed by access request conditions.

        If `requestedBy` and `requestedFor` aren't the same, then you must also enable the [`requestOnBehalfOfSettings`](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings/operation/updateResourceRequestSettingsV2!path=requestOnBehalfOfSettings&t=request) parameter in the access request settings. See [Update the resource request settings](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Request-Settings/#tag/Request-Settings/operation/updateResourceRequestSettingsV2).

        Include the following information in the payload:

        - The Okta user ID for the user who requires access. Add the user ID in the `requestedFor.externalId` parameter.
        - The catalog entry ID of the resource required by the user. Add the catalog ID in the `requested.entryId` parameter.
        - If the request conditions include requester input fields, add field information in the `requesterFieldValues` array. See [Retrieve the request fields](https://developer.okta.com/docs/api/iga/openapi/governance.requests.admin.v2/tag/Catalogs/#tag/Catalogs/operation/getCatalogEntryRequestFieldsV2).
        - Optional: The user ID of the person submitting the request. By default, this value is the admin user ID requesting this operation and doesn't need to be provided. However, to add a different Okta user ID for the request, include the `requestedBy.externalId` parameter in the request body.

        When creating a request condition, you specify:

        - What resource can be requested? (`resourceId` in path)
        - What access scope can be requested? (`accessScopeSettings` in request body)
        - Who can request access? (`requesterSettings` in request body)
        - What is the approval process? (`approvalSequenceId` in request body)

        Any `requesterSettings`, `accessScopeSettings` in the update request body will be validated against the resource's current request settings.

        Request conditions will have an inactive status after succesful creation.

        Conditions can be updated while their status is ACTIVE, INACTIVE or INVALID.

        An update will be rejected if it would lead to the condition entering an INVALID status.

        While an update request body may not contain `status`, a successful update request condition operation will always result in the condition entering ACTIVE or INACTIVE status.

        Any `requesterSettings`, `accessScopeSettings` in the update request body will be validated against the resource's current request settings.

        Retrieves the request settings for a resource

        Resource request settings are useful for determining what kind of request conditions
        can be created or updated for a resource.

        For example:

        - `validAccessScopeSettings` indicates what `accessScopeSettings` may be passed in a `Create request condition` or `Update request condition` operation.
        - `validRequesterSettings` indicates what `requesterSettings` may be passed in a `Create request condition` or `Update request condition` operation.
        - `validAccessDurationSettings` indicates the maximum duration the user will have access to the resources.
        - `validRiskSettings` indicates what `riskSettings` may be passed. Currently, it can be at the resource request settings.
        - `validRequestOnBehalfOfSettings` indicates the available request on behalf of settings for the resource.
        - `requestOnBehalfOfSettings` if they exist, they indicate the settings specified for request on behalf of.
        - `riskSettings` if they exist, they indicate the risk settings specified for the resource.

        See response examples for various possible request setting scenarios.

        and the following required and optional properties.

        **Required**: You must specify both principal and resource references with one of these sets of properties:
        * `principal.externalId`, `principal.type`, `resource.externalId`, and `resource.type`
        * `principalOrn` and `resourceOrn`
        * `principalId` and `resourceId`

        **Optional**: You can optionally filter by a date range with the following properties:
        * `startDate`: Start of the date range (inclusive) in ISO 8601 UTC format. If omitted, data is retrieved from the earliest available records.
        * `endDate`: End of the date range (inclusive) in ISO 8601 UTC format. If omitted, data is retrieved up to the current time.

        **Note:** Query parameter percent encoding is required. See [Percent-encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding).

      x-enumDescriptions:
        USER: A single reviewer reviews the campaign. The `reviewerSettings.reviewerId` property is required for this reviewer type.
        REVIEWER_EXPRESSION: Specifies an expression to derive a reviewer for the campaign. This reviewer type is typically used for the manager reviewer use case (`reviewerSettings.reviewerScopeExpression` indicates the user's manager). The `reviewerSettings.fallBackReviewerId` property is required, and is used if Okta can't determine the reviewer based on the required `reviewerSettings.reviewerScopeExpression` property.
        GROUP: All the members of an Okta group specified in `reviewerSettings.reviewerGroupId` are the reviewers for the campaign. The `reviewerSettings.reviewerGroupId` property is required for this reviewer type. If the group specified in `reviewerSettings.reviewerGroupId` contains only one member, then that member is assigned as the reviewer for all reviews, and the `reviewerType` is set to `USER` for those reviews. When the campaign launches, if the group has more than 10 members, 10 members from the group are randomly set as reviewers for the campaign.
        RESOURCE_OWNER: The resource owners are the reviewers for the campaign. The `reviewerSettings.fallBackReviewerId` property is required, and is set as the reviewer if resource owners aren't found or are unsupported for the resource. If resource owners are configured, the reviewers are derived from owners of the resources specified in `resourceSettings.targetResources`.<br>**Note:** For certifying AD groups, the `fallBackReviewerId` is always used because resource owners for AD groups aren't supported.
        MULTI_LEVEL: A campaign with reviews that can be reviewed and passed on from a reviewer at one level to a reviewer at the next level. This setting provides a sequence of reviewers who can decide on the final outcome of the reviews. A maximum of two reviewer levels are supported. `reviewerSettings.reviewerLevels` is required, and all other properties in `reviewerSettings` are ignored.

        Applicable only, if `interval` is in terms of N months. Specifies the day-of-the-month on which, the campaign should be repeated. If the `interval` is in terms of days, weeks or years, this property can be ignored.

        1) `SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the day-of-the-month in `startDate`. For eg: if `startDate` happens to be `5th` of some date, then campaign will repeat on 5th day of the matching month.

        2) `SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the day-of-the-week in `startDate`. For eg if `startDate` happens to be `Thursday`, then campaign will repeat on `Thursday` of the matching week.

        2) `LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - Specifies the last day-of-the-week in `startDate`. For eg jf `startDate` happens to be `Thursday` and it is the last week of the month, then campaign will repeat on `Thursday` of the matching last week.

        Refer few examples below:
          1) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P3M` (Every 3 months) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE`- the `startDate` happens to be in the first week, and it is a `Thursday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `3 months` and will start on `first week's Thursday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|

              |...          |                          |

          2) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be `1st` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `1st day of the month`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun  1st, Thursday,  2023|

          3) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 1st 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the first week, and it is a `Thursday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `first week's Thursday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|

          4) Let's say the campaign start date is `May 23rd 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the fourth week, and it is a `Tuesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `fourth week's Tuesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | May  23rd, Tuesday,  2023|

          5) Let's say the campaign start date is `May 29rd 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` - the `startDate` happens to be in the last week, and it is a `Monday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Monday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | May  29th, Monday,   2023|
              | 2           | Jun  26th, Monday,   2023|
              | 3           | Jul  31st, Monday,   2023|
              | 4           | Aug  28th, Monday,   2023|
              |...          |                          |

          6) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 28th 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be `28th` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `28th day of the month`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun 28th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 2           | Jul 28th, Friday,    2023|
              | 3           | Aug 28th, Monday,    2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          7) Let's say the campaign start date is `June 28th 2023`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be the last week of the month, and it is a `Wednesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Wednesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jun 28th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 2           | Jul 26th, Wednesday, 2023|
              | 3           | Aug 30th, Wednesday, 2023|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          8) Let's say the campaign start date is `Jan 31st 2024`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: LAST_WEEKDAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be the last week of the month, and it is a `Wednesday`. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `last week's Wednesday`. In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|
              | 1           | Jan 31st, Wednesday, 2024|
              | 2           | Feb 28th, Wednesday, 2024|
              | 3           | Mar 27th, Wednesday, 2024|
              |...          |                          |
              |...          |                          |

          9) Let's say the campaign start date is `Jan 31st 2024`, the `interval: P1M` (Every 1 month) and `repeatOnType: SAME_DAY_AS_START_DATE` -  the `startDate` happens to be `31st` day of the month. Hence the campaign will repeat every `1 month` and will start on `31st` or `30th` or `28/29th`(for February). In this example, some sample campaign occurrences are below -

              | Campaign No |Date of recurrence        |
              |-------------|--------------------------|

        You can specify the campaign recurring frequency using `interval` and `repeatOn`.
        Optionally specify `ends` with a date-time, when the campaign schedule can end.
      required:
        - interval
      properties:
        interval:
          type: string
          format: duration
          description: |
            Recurrence interval specified according to ISO8061 notation for durations.
            Refer https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/duration.html for all supported values.
            Recurring campaigns support - daily, weekly, monthly and yearly interval.
            One can setup a "interval" to max of -
              - 182 days (That is `P182D`)
              - 26 weeks (equivalent of 182 days, that is `P26W`)
              - 24 months (That is `P24M`)
              - 2 years (That is `P2Y`).

            Few examples to better understand, how `interval` is used.
            If the `startDate` is `June 28th 2023` and the intent is to repeat the campaign -
              1) Every 25 days, specify "P25D".
              2) Every 4 weeks specify "P4W". In this example the `startDate` happens to be a `Wednesday`, the campaign would run every `Wednesday` of 4th week of the month.
              3) Every 3 months specify "P3M". In this example the `startDate` is on 28th day. Hence, campaigns repeats every 3 months on 28th day.
              4) Every 2 years specify "P2Y". In this example, the `startDate` is `Jun 28`. Hence repeats every 2 yrs on `Jun 28th`.

              Also note that, the `interval` should not conflict `durationInDays`. For eg: If `durationInDays` is specified as 21 days, but interval is `P2W` (Every 2 weeks), it becomes an invalid request, as duration of the campaign conflicts with the next recurrence of the campaign.

        A request type has a status lifecycle described in our [request type lifecycle documentation](/#request-type-status-lifecycle).

        A request type may start with a status of DRAFT or ACTIVE, based on the status property in the Add request body.

        The publish, unpublish, and delete operations all affect a request type's status.

        Additionally, if any operation detects invalid settings, such as an approver who is no longer in the organization, the request type automatically transitions to disabled.

            The ID of a `requesterField`.

            For `OKTA` request approval, this is typically the ID of an input field defined in an approval sequence.

            For `EXTERNAL` request approval, this is the ID of an input field relevant to the external approval system.

            The following are reserved identifiers:
            - `ACCESS_DURATION`: An identifier used to specify the duration of the access being requested. (**Note:**
              This identifier is to be grandfathered. The new name will be `OKTA_ACCESS_DURATION`.)
            - `OKTA_REQUESTED_FOR`: An identifier used to specify who the resource is being requested for
            - `OKTA_ACCESS_DURATION`: An identifier used to specify the duration of the requested access. If a request
              field is included in this ID, the field value must be a `DURATION` expression in ISO format. The maximum
              length of this value is 5 characters. For example, `P1D` represents a duration of one day.
            - Any identifiers with `OKTA_` prefix are reserved for future use.

            - `ISO_DATE`: An ISO formatted date string. for example, `2022-05-05T14:15:22Z`
            - `DURATION`: An ISO format duration expression with a maximum length of 5 characters. For example,
              `P1D` indicates a duration of one day.
            - `OKTA_USER_ID`: Okta User ID

        For the Okta approval system, the required fields are defined in the approval sequence. Ensure that the requester
        input fields match up with this definition to avoid request approval flow failure.

        For external approval systems, the requester input fields are for recording purposes only and do not affect the approval
        process.
